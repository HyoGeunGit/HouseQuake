# Earthquake: IBM Call for Code

AngelHack Hackathon Seoul, June 2019 <br>
The Pitch<br>
Greeting<br>
안녕하세요! (annyeonghaseyo!) Hello guys! <br>
Quick Intro<br>
Last year more than 10,000 buildings were destroyed because of natural disasters in California. <br>In Korea 1,000 buildings were destroyed 2 years ago.<br>
# Problem
20% could resist if maintained properly. Well-timed condition assessment and repair is required to protect against failures.<br>
We’ve done some research on building condition assessment techniques and target to optimize the visual based ones.<br>
Solution
Our mobile application allows to take a photo of the building or its part – a wall for example, and analyses the photo to<br> estimate the risk of the building to crash during an earthquake or a hurricane.<br>
We use some basic plate tectonics knowledge, climate knowledge, as well as historical data tied to a particular location or area to estimate the challenge a building may have to resist.<br>
For buildings at risk our platform allows to organize funding to repair it. The funding process is maintained transparent by keeping all the transactions in the open distributed ledger.<br>
# Next Steps
Our next steps include applying to related government programs and cooperation with insurance companies.<br>
We continue our work to improve the platform usability, quality of assessment and scope of appliance.<br>
# Team
Our team is an international multi-language speaking team. It combines creativity, <br>experience and unique set of connections from korean and european spots required to develop the prototyped idea to the next level.
Thank you. 고맙습니다 (gomabseubnida).

# Questions (Optional)
20% of the buildings designed to resist to a particular level of external <br>influence fail because of aging.
