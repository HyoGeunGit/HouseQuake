#Earthquake: IBM Call for Code

The Pitch
Greeting
안녕하세요! (annyeonghaseyo!) Hello guys! 
Quick Intro
Last year more than 10,000 buildings were destroyed because of natural disasters in California. In Korea 1,000 buildings were destroyed 2 years ago.
Problem
20% could resist if maintained properly. Well-timed condition assessment and repair is required to protect against failures.
We’ve done some research on building condition assessment techniques and target to optimize the visual based ones.
Solution
Our mobile application allows to take a photo of the building or its part – a wall for example, and analyses the photo to estimate the risk of the building to crash during an earthquake or a hurricane.
We use some basic plate tectonics knowledge, climate knowledge, as well as historical data tied to a particular location or area to estimate the challenge a building may have to resist.
For buildings at risk our platform allows to organize funding to repair it. The funding process is maintained transparent by keeping all the transactions in the open distributed ledger.
Next Steps
Our next steps include applying to related government programs and cooperation with insurance companies.
We continue our work to improve the platform usability, quality of assessment and scope of appliance.
Team
Our team is an international multi-language speaking team. It combines creativity, experience and unique set of connections from korean and european spots required to develop the prototyped idea to the next level.
Thank you. 고맙습니다 (gomabseubnida).
